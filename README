The asmbl-comp package contains scripts for comparing two assemblies. The
following are required to run asmbl-comp.

  * GNU make
  * a Perl interpreter
  * the 'Graph' Perl module
  * NCBI BLAST+

Running asmbl-comp is as simple as running `make'. However, you will need to
adjust some values in the makefile, either by manually editing the file or by
changing these values on the command line (preferred).

If $BIN is the asmbl-comp directory, $WD is your working directory, and
`one.fasta' and `two.fasta' are the assemblies (in the working directory) you
want to compare, the commands you need to run will look something like this.

  cd $WD
  make -f $BIN/Makefile -s BIN=$BIN EVALUE=1e-15

To take advantage of multiple cores, use make's `-j' option (which specifies how
many tasks can run concurrently) and the BLASTTHREADS option (which indicates how
many cores/threads each BLAST process should use). For example, if I had 8 cores
available, I might want to run 2 processes concurrently, with each BLAST process
using 4 cores. The command would like like this.

  make -f $BIN/Makefile -s -j 2 BIN=$BIN EVALUE=1e-15 BLASTTHREADS=4

The results will be written to a file name `seq_clust.txt', and a summary report
will be printed to the terminal.
